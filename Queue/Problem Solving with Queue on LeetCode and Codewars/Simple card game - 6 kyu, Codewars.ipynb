    "with a really simple game. Write a function called winner and figure out who is going to win.\n",
    "They are dealt the same number of cards. They both flip the card on the top of their deck. Whoever has \n",
    "a card with higher value wins the round and gets one point (if the cards are of the same value, neither \n",
    "of them gets a point). After this, the two cards are discarded and they flip another card from the top \n",
    "of their deck. They do this until they have no cards left.\n",
    "deckSteve and deckJosh are arrays representing their decks. They are filled with cards, represented by \n",
